Team B - Project 3: Powershell Scripting

<#
Gather information about Windows computers on the network


•	You should primarily use WMI classes to gather information.  
•	Your script should be as comprehensive as possible.
•	Example information may include BIOS information, programs installed on the computer, current programs running, accounts that exist on the computer, etc.
•	While the script by default should run on the machine where it is executed, it should also be able to be executed for a remote machine (assuming you have rights).
o	You can create a test environment using the VMs you have setup for this class;
•	Your script should be able to be called from a PowerShell console and appropriate parameters passed to it.
•	Feel free to use the internet to find potential solutions; however, you should not copy scripts exactly as you find them online.  You should write them yourself but can be guided by what you find. 
•	Make sure that you comment your script.
•	Your script should save the output of the information that it gathers to a file. You can determine the type and organization of the file.
